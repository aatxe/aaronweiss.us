I'm Aaron Weiss, a first-year PhD and [NSF Fellow](https://nsfgrfp.org) at
[Northeastern](https://www.ccs.neu.edu) verifying compilers with
[Amal Ahmed](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/).

As an undergraduate, I worked with [Arjun Guha](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/) on static
verification and update synthesis for [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) manifests.

I'm an open source software developer with about a decade of experience. My favorite languages are
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/), and
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).
