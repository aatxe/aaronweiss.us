I'm Aaron Weiss! I'm a graduating junior from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

I'm a research assistant to Prof. [Arjun Guha](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/) where I work on
static verification and synthesis of [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) manifests.

I'm an open source software developer with about a decade of experience. My favorite languages are
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/), and
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).
