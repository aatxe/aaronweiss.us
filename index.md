I'm Aaron Weiss, a fourth-year PhD student and [NSF Fellow](https://nsfgrfp.org) at
[Northeastern](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) designing type systems with
[Amal Ahmed](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/).

As an undergraduate, I worked with [Arjun Guha](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/) on static
verification and update synthesis for [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) manifests.

I'm an open source software developer with about a decade of experience, mostly in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).
