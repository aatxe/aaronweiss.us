I'm Aaron Weiss! I'm a second-year student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, slated to
graduate in 2017. I'm interested in type and programming language theory, and I'm very passionate
about languages with strong type systems. I'm also an open source software developer with roughly 
eight years of experience. I prefer to program in Rust and Haskell, but I've got a lot of experience
with Java, Scala, and C# as well. I've also done quite a bit of work on the web.

I'm a research assistant to Prof. [Arjun Guha](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/) in the 
[PLASMA](http://plasma.cs.umass.edu/) research group. We're working on solving interesting problems
with techniques from programming language theory. I used to work at a financial services startup
called [ProtoIPO](http://protoipo.com/) designing user interfaces and experiences. You can find
more information on my [CV](/cv.pdf).

In my spare time, I'll work on anything from websites to networking libraries to programming 
languages to video game server emulators. You can check out my work on GitHub 
[here](https://github.com/aatxe). I also run my own IRC network in my free time called 
[PdgnCo](http://pdgn.co/). It's founded on democratic and anarchistic principles, and I operate it
accordingly. I also spend some time [blogging](/archive.html).

I'm a denizen of the web. If you're looking to contact me, you can find me all over the place. I'm
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aatxe), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/aaronweiss74), 
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+AaronWeiss74), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/aaronweiss74), 
and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/awe). You can also talk to me on 
[FyreChat](irc://irc.fyrechat.net/vana) or [PdgnCo](ircs://irc.pdgn.co:6697/pdgn) as awe, or on
[freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net/) as aatxe. You can  also email me at
[awe@pdgn.co](mailto:awe@pdgn.co). You'll probably find me elsewhere, too. Older accounts will be
under the name aaronweiss74. More recent accounts will be under awe or aatxe.
