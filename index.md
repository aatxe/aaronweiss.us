I'm Aaron Weiss! I'm a first-year student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, slated to
graduate in 2017. I'm interested in type and programming language theory, and I'm very passionate
about languages with strong type systems. I'm also an open source software developer with roughly 
eight years of experience. I prefer to program in Rust and Haskell, but I've got a lot of experience
with Java and C# as well. I've also done quite a bit of work on the web.

I work at a financial services startup called [ProtoIPO](http://protoipo.com/) designing user
interfaces and experiences. We're building a platform to change the nature of capital investment.
You can find out more about what we do on [our website](http://protoipo.com/). My work is focused 
primarily on making sure our clients' portals are both flexible and beautiful in presentation.

In my spare time, I'll work on anything from websites to networking libraries to programming 
languages to video game server emulators. You can check out my work on GitHub 
[here](https://github.com/aatxe), or through the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tent"></span> in 
the top right. I also run my own IRC network in my free time called [PdgnCo](http://pdgn.co/). It's
 based on democratic and anarchistic ideals!


I'm a denizen of the web. If you're looking to contact me, you can find me all over the place. I'm
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aatxe), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/aaronweiss74), 
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+AaronWeiss74), and 
[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/aaronweiss74). You can also talk to me on 
[FyreChat](irc://irc.fyrechat.net/vana) or [PdgnCo](ircs://irc.pdgn.co:6697/pdgn) as awe. You'll 
probably find me elsewhere, too. Older accounts will be under the name aaronweiss74. More 
recent accounts will be under awe or aatxe.
