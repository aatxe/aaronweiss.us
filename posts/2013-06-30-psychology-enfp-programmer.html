<p>In my experiences, I’ve found that a good lot of the programmers I interact with are characteristically an archetypal INTP according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a> system. It makes sense since it’s the sort of personality that’s usually attributed to STEM careers. This means that, for such people, programming is all about themselves. They strive to meet objective goals for their own sake. I know a lot of programmers like this. My good friend, <a href="https://github.com/retep998">Peter Atashian</a>, is a good example. Now, these types of people make fantastic programmers. In my experiences, they’re all extremely capable and produce highly performant code. Sometimes, they might have issues with readability and I’ve talked about that with Peter, but overall, they really are great programmers. I used to be that sort of person when I was younger. I used to be that sort of person when I first started programming actually. That’s what brought me to it.</p>
<p>It was actually just before 7th grade when I first started programming. At the time, I was a pretty cocky kid. I’m still arrogant in some ways, but it was really different back then. It was sort of programmed into my personality not to care about anyone but myself. I acted solely on my own accord and for my own benefit. When I stumbled onto the idea that I could make software, it felt like a natural extension of my personality and my talents. I was extremely math-minded and I had started using Linux fairly recently before that. It all was very natural, or at least I was convinced it was. I spent two years programming C++ but honestly, I never really <em>programmed</em> anything. Nothing substantial anyway. I can’t even really remember anything I worked on, besides a few poorly designed text-based RPGs. Once I got into high school, I joined our <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST</a> team and from there, I taught myself Java. The first thing I ever made in Java was a clock program that synced with a time server. I was convinced that I was really good because I had read about concurrency in a little book I got and used it to implement the synchronization. I wasn’t very good. To be quite frank, I’m still not very good. Still, I’ve learned literally magnitudes more in the past year than I had in any of the four years prior to that that I had been programming.</p>
<p>This past year has actually been a huge year in growth for me overall. As a programmer, I was introduced to a whole array of new technologies, techniques, and whatnot to help me be better. I started using Maven exclusively. I adopted Netty and Guava for my projects. I took on some OpenGL and I learned quite a bit there. I learned about a variety of design models, especially event-based design. I started learning Haskell and all the very Computer Science-y terminology that goes along with it. I also changed a lot as a person though. It was a long time coming with changes cropping up throughout high school, but it really culminated into a whole this year. The year started off with a pretty bad struggle with my depression, as is most evidently visible by my contributions on GitHub. It got a bit better when I made a good friend, but I fell into old habits and I fucked everything up. Between therapy and just living, I tried to pick up the pieces from there. Around the end of this past year, I had actually made another new friend. We had a long conversation about psychology which actually sparked our friendship. By the end of that conversation, for the first time since I had first been exposed to personality typings, I tested something different. Both with and without testing, I had always been a classic INTP but in that moment, when I reassessed how I’d changed and how my motivations changed, I saw that the very basis of who I was had changed. It caught me by surprise. My primary motivations were externalized. The very premise of my perspective on the world around me had shifted fundamentally. Obviously, it’s not called one’s formative years for nothing but all of this made it very real to me. I had completely and wholly become an ENFP. It’s ironic too since I never really subscribed much to the belief that you could type-cast people accurately, yet here I am.</p>
<p>So, as a result of this change, I’ve had to take the time to re-evaluate what I enjoy about programming and what motivates me in it. I’ve had quite a few conversations with people about it, and one of them actually managed to draw some tears. I’ve found that everything that I’m programming, I’m doing so for other people, and yet I’m failing. It’s not necessarily that it’s sad, but there’s a very exact degree of emotion tied into such a failure. It’s actually rather interesting, I’d think, how my motivations shifted though. I went from programming for my own sake to programming completely for others. When I approach a problem, my primary concern is with how others might benefit from each approach I might take. Ultimately, I’ve drawn a lot of my design decisions from how I feel it might benefit others in using the software I develop. I’d say that’s probably a pretty good thing, but it comes with its problems too. Those problems are where the sadness and inevitable depression comes in.</p>
<p>As my motivation in programming comes primarily from others, I feel myself locked into a need to convince others to use the software I write. I work painstakingly to make it worth using and to make it seem more worthwhile to use than it really is. In a lot of ways, it comes down to a lot of marketing. In any way I choose to release something, I try to sell it. Despite the fact that everything I release is free, I still am selling them as products to end-users. Another friend of mine actually noted that I have a very distinct style in the way I write readme files. He noticed that I have a way of writing very cheerfully. He made no comment as to whether it was a good thing or not but regardless, I find it yet another instance of my marketing my software. In a lot of ways, it feels like a curse for me to have to program in this way. I’m bound by this need to achieve for others and it hurts me deeply when I fail to fulfill it. Having developed a few libraries recently to the point of contentment with both performance and design, it hurts me to see that there’s not a soul using them. I didn’t write them for me. I never wanted to write them for me. I wanted other people to have them. That’s why they’re free. That’s why they’re open source. That’s why they’re licensed under what I find to be the most permissive and reasonable software license. Every bit of it is for other people.</p>
<p>With this motivation in mind, my whole perspective on software development has evolved as well. I’ve found myself talking a lot about how programming is a social activity. It’s weird to put it like that. I know most people have this idea that programmers are the types of people that hold themselves up in a shell and work entirely by themselves. It fits right in with the stereotypical INTP personality attributed to programming types. Whether that’s how it is or not for others, I’m positive that that isn’t how it is for me. I’ve found myself more-or-less touting what I imagine to be the GitHub in-house philosophy. I’ve adopted this view that everything in software development is actually about other programmers and about end-users. I talk about it a lot too. I love every social piece of programming and that’s what gives it meaning to me now. It’s a long shot from what it once was though.</p>
<p>From coding for myself to coding for others, I’m happy with where I am now. It’s stressful and often times depressing but it ultimately yields far more motivation for me. While it’s been slow, I have become more productive. As I said, I’ve brought two libraries to a state of relative completeness. One was <a href="http://aaronweiss74.github.io/pkgnx/">pkgnx</a> and the other was <a href="https://github.com/aaronweiss74/juicebot">juicebot</a>. I intend, of course, on continuing to work on new projects for others with the sincerest hope that something will stick. I have hope for the future, I have hope for my projects, and I have hope for myself. I’m just going to keep working at it all now.</p>
