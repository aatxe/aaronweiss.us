description: I designed a small webapp to display the books I've read.

I'll try to be fairly brief about this. Having picked up reading frequently again on my iPad, I've decided that I'd like to better document the books that I'm reading. So, to do so, I've started a small project called Bibliome. It's nothing too complex, really. My whole goal is to keep it as simple as humanly possibly, at least for now. It's just a neat display of the books I've read using the Google Books API. All I need to do is keep updated a very simple yaml file with the ISBN for the book. You can check out [my Bibliome](http://bibliome.aaronweiss.us/) or you can check out [the code](https://github.com/aatxe/Bibliome) to host your own. It requires some slight tweakage to get it running on Heroku properly because of the Google API. However, that'll probably find it's way back into the master on GitHub soon. Anyway, enjoy!
