title: Yet Another Little Project
description: I made a small website that displays whether or not it's my high school graduation day.

Yup, you heard it right. Even after I just released the tiny, minimalisic project that is [Bibliome](https://github.com/aatxe/Bibliome), I've released yet another tiny pet project. In fact, believe it or not, this one is even less substantial. The project itself is named [isigy](https://github.com/aatxe/isigy) which is short for "IS IT GRADUATION YET?" However, the only live demo of it is called [isgrad](http://isgrad.aaronweiss.us/). It's just an extremely simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web application with some really basic controls. Technically, it could be retrofitted to tell whether it's any date in particular. All you'd have to do is change the page title. That being said, the project is named for it's original intent. The live demo is, of course, for my high school graduation. It will, indeed, say "YES" when the date matches. That's all there is to it. Carry on.
