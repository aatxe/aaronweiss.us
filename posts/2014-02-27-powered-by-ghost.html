<p>Welp, it’s that time of the year again. Following a continued history of personal dissatisfaction with my own web presence, I’ve decided to release yet another redesign for my website. This time, the site is powered by <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, a modern node.js blogging platform. I’ve designed the entire site as a public domain theme built for Ghost called <a href="https://github.com/aaronweiss74/Ghastly">Ghastly</a>. Personally, I’m very pleased with how it came out.</p>
<p>My focus with the new design is to refine the goals from my most recent design into a more unified experience. I tried to better capture flat, minimalist design here and I sought specifically to incorporate a strong focus on content. I feel my previous site suffered greatly from an inability to center around content, and that’s also a big part of the motivation for using Ghost. I’m hoping that by building the site on a blogging platform, I’ll be more focused on the production of content.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the focus of my content is likely to be different now. I’m going to try to focus more on writing content about software that I’m developing to various degrees of technicality. I also hope to incorporate content that explores the relationships between programmers, software, and one another. If I feel that it is to my own benefit, I may also take the time to publish posts about books that I’ve read and my understanding of them. I’ve also migrated some of my old posts here. I suppose, in that sense, the content basis will still be rather broad here. Nevertheless, my hope is to provide more content of a higher calibre.</p>
<p>Finally, as a small note, the title of this blog may change from time to time and without warning. The original title, while it was under development, was “Han Shot First.” For many, this should easily be recognizable as a reference to the controversial change made between Star Wars: A New Hope and the Director’s Cut. The title that I set with the release, “Sitting In My Little Room,” is a reference to the White Stripes song, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QfDU3jd-tGQ/">Little Room</a>. I may continue to give explanations of future titles. I may not. We’ll see.</p>
