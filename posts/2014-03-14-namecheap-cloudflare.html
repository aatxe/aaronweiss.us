<p>After dealing with increasing frustrations with my old webhost IPOWER (as they still managed my domain registrations), I made the decision today to migrate over to <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> based on a few recommendations I received. In the process, I also chose to route my sites through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> primarily for the ease-of-use, but also for the variety of features they offer for free. Thus far, I’m pleased with the decision I’ve made and I hope that it’s helping me to offer a faster website.</p>
<p>Now over at Namecheap, I’m also going to be looking into new mailing solutions to replace the old ones that powered my domain-based email addresses. I’m considering both <a href="http://www.mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/">Google Apps</a>. As of right now, I’ve yet to make a decision, but I’ll update this post when I do. In the meantime, I’m unable to receive mail sent to my old deviant-core address.</p>
<p><strong>Update (March 18th, 2014):</strong> I’ve been using Mailgun because of the nature of the email addresses as rarely used and primarily deprecated. It’s been working nicely for me thus far. I can still send and receive emails properly through the addresses, and they all go through Gmail. As a result, I still see them on <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/">Mailbox</a> on my phone and tablet. While Mailgun doesn’t recommend the usage of their services for personal email, for this use case, it seems to work well enough.</p>
