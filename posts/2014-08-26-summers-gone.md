title: Summer's Gone
description: I lament my lack of open source development over the summer, and discuss my new goals.

It's the end of August now, and I'm leaving for school tomorrow. A twenty-two hour drive from southwest Florida to Amherst, MA awaits me. If you were to judge this summer based on my GitHub contributions, it'd appear to be one in which I very nearly disappeared entirely. However, ultimately, it was a very different summer than those in the past.

You'll see that there were almost no contributions during the entire course of the summer. This differs greatly from past summers where I demonstrated far more productivity than throughout the school year. This change is the result of two major changes in the past year.

Firstly, I've been working at a financial services startup called ProtoIPO. I can't say much about it, but I will specify that my work there is mainly web-based. Most of my development energy has been directed towards that end. The commits on GitHub this summer have been limited almost strictly to my website. As a result, this has been a summer of web development. This differs greatly from the past few years where most of my work has been directed towards networking, especially MapleStory.

Secondly, I've grown seriously unhappy with Java as a language. Despite recent improvements to the language, I've become increasingly dissatisfied with it as I learn more about functional or functional-influenced languages. In particular, I'm very interested in both [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) and [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). Still, if that was the only issue, I'd have work in either of those languages. Ultimately, coupled with this unhappiness with Java is a continued inability to motivate myself to really buckle down and learn either language. I know the syntax of both, but I  haven't made an active effort to really use them. 

This is the result of the combination of an inability to select a personal project that I'm really passionate about and the technical challenge of trying to learn a language by working on a large project. Ultimately, I know that the best approach would be to start with smaller projects, but I'm almost completely lacking smaller ideas to implement in order to learn. This is the viscious cycle that fueled my lack of productivity on personal projects this past summer. 

My aim is to remedy the issue going forward, and to really get into both languages as best I can. So, I leave this post as documentation of my summer. It wasn't the best one for me as an open source developer, but my hope is to produce even better open source software going forward.
