<p>It’s been just shy of a year since I switched to Ghost. Today, I made a big jump away from it. I made the decision to make my site static and to serve it via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a> (GitHub’s, in particular). There were two primary motivations behind this change. The first is that I was concerned about how I was managing the current site. The second is that I was concerned about the old design.</p>
<p>My concerns about management did not leave me alone. The point was iterated, admittedly with bias, by <a href="https://eager.io/blog/build-static-websites/">Zack Bloom at Eager.io</a>. I was running my blog on a small server, and it’s likely that it wouldn’t be able to take any serious traffic hits before it crumbled. Further, I had to go through the effort of actually managing a Ghost installation. This meant keeping things up to date, and given my post frequency, I wasn’t very good at that either. Unable to have a separate server for my website, I was actually sharing it with the server I was using for my IRC network. So, anything that impacted one was liable to impact the other. I wasn’t satisfied with this at all. The site is now completely static and generated with Hakyll, and the only concern I have is writing, and then rebuilding the site when I make changes. That’s just a short <code>./site build</code> away.</p>
<p>I also had some long-standing design concerns. I liked my old design, but as it aged, a lot of the warts became more and more apparent. Despite my strive for minimalism, the focus was definitely more on flashiness than it was on content. There was a rough looking CSS transition to view the list of blog posts, and it caused hiccups in a few browsers. Some viewers of the site believed it to be a bug! The blog posts themselves were much too wide, making them difficult to read, and the glaringly bright background colors made the page hard to look at. I’ve taken a very different approach with this new site. I’ve retried minimalism, and this time it’s not flat. My new design aims to focus strictly on content. There’s as few distractions as I could possibly muster. All the content is still here, and now it’s easier than ever to consume.</p>
