<p>I write things sometimes! Topics can range anywhere from technical to personal and everything in
between. I probably write the most about programming and the way I look at and feel about it. I 
don't post very often, but I do try to post when I get the chance. Here's all of the things that 
I've written to date in order from most to least recent.</p>
<div class="post-list">
    $partial("templates/post-list.html")$
